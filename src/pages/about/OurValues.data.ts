        "We wake up every day excited to build products we're proud of — not only in terms of achieving the highest quality, but in doing that the right way. 100% of the bovine leather used on our products comes from Tier 1 USA cattle. We also work exclusively with tanneries that can provide traceable material records and have received high marks from the Leather Working Group (LWG) for both environmental practices and chemical management. We regularly visit all key material suppliers in person and require similar audit documentation from hardware, lace, and sole manufacturers. The shoe and leather industries are rife with unfair labor and environmental practices, and we aim to raise the bar.",

When we think about Team Thursday, we think about all of the people who dedicate their lives to making each of the materials that go into our products; we think about the local communities in which those materials are made; and of course, we think about you, our amazing customers! We are honored to have the opportunity to make products we love and to make a positive impact in the lives of everyone in the Team Thursday family. From all of us, thank you!",
